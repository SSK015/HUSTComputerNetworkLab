# HUSTComputerNetworkLab
My impl of HUST Computer Network Exp(2023 Autumn).

## Exp 1 Socket Lab
- On Windows
- GNU Compiler
### Notice that we won't use Visual Studio to code our Exp
We choose **cmake** toolkit and use a gcc compiler. 

The Exp can only support running on a windows OS as the Exp requires use socket lib from win

## Exp 2 Reliable Data Transfer Protocols
- On Ubuntu20.04 LTS
- GNU Compiler
